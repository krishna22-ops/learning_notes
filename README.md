#  Python Basics â€“ Data Science Learning Journey

Hi! I'm currently learning Python as part of my journey into data science. This repository contains basic Python programs and beginner-level projects I've built to solidify my understanding.

##  Topics I've Learned So Far (till 9th July 2025)

- Variables and Data Types
- Input and Output
- Arithmetic Operations
- Conditional Statements (if/else)
- String formatting (f-strings)
- List and Dictionaries 
- If-else statements                       

## Topics I learned on 10th July 2025:

- For loops 
- Def functions 
- OS Module 
- Practiced some tasks for the above mentioned topics (Link:https://github.com/krishna22-ops/Practice-Task)

## Topics I learned on 11th July 2025:

- Pandas {Need to practice more}
- NumPy {Need to practice more}
- Create a dataframe using list and dictionaries 
- Import a csv file and read it

## Topics I learned on 12th July 2025:

- Basic Attributes (shape, index, columns, dtypes)
- Functions (max, min, len, round, type)
- Methods (describe, info, head, tails)
- Select a single column using [] and dot(.)
- Using the dot may not work in some cases, so we have to use it as a string.

## Decided to make another SQL Project based on real world data (13-16th July 2025) so I don't forget everything about SQL.
